## Introduction

Spotify is a music, podcast, and video streaming service. It provides digital rights management - protected content from record labels and media companies. One of Spotifyâ€™s primary products is Playlists, collections of tracks that users (and / or Spotify) can build for any mood or event. With over 40 million songs available, the company attempts to direct the most relevant songs to users based on their preferences.
These Playlists are compiled in a complex manner, involving both human-led and computer-led processes. What stands is that algorithmically curated discovery playlists, and their effectiveness, remain an important business interest for the company. 

The overarching goal of this project is to understand how these algorithms can be evaluated and improved with machine learning techniques.
